1. determine closure - in borel-set-methods
	should method for explicit-finite-interesection be the same as it is for
	explicit-finite-union

2. touchp - right but I could change it's name

3. using same-set-p instead of eq - waste of time? or not?, see set-union-methods
- difference between eq, eql, etc.
	methinks the answer was, just use eq or did I even ask the question

4 can I assume that if your set is an explicit-finite-intersection that
	it can't be reduced any further?  and how about it for countable-intersections
	yes, assume this is true -- the idiot be hanged

5. example, intersection between an interval and a countable-union
	should I be just using contains-set-p or should I also be checking for overlappage
	no 

6. in countable-intersection and EFIs
 does contain-set-p (or not) refer to the actually contained sets or what it represents
	refers to the actual sets
 and disjointness?
	the mathematic truth
