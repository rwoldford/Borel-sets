;;;                             BOREL SETS
;;;
;;;  In this file the classes representing Borel-Sets and operators on those
;;;  classes are defined.  Various specialized methods which implement the
;;;  operators are defined elsewhere.
;;;
;;;  Examples are given in "borel-examples.lisp".
;;;  Special instances and relates functions, constants, and variables
;;;  are in "borel-special.lisp".
;;;
;;;  In the sequel, the base set, of which every set defined here is a subset,
;;;  is the extended real line:
;;;
;;;                [ -infinity, +infinity ]
;;;
;;;  Other important notes: *********************************************************
;;;
;;;       1. Where sensible, all operators are n-ary for n >=1
;;;          Each operator will invoke a binary method having the same name as the
;;;          operator except prefixed by "op".  For example, set-union is the name of the
;;;          general n-ary union operator which calls the method op-set-union on two arguments.
;;;          The "op" operators are specialized to do the right things on the basis
;;;          of their argument types.
;;;
;;;       2. Any extended real number (extended-real-p => T) can be treated as if
;;;          it were either a countable-set or an interval.
;;;          In either case the set is closed and has the extended real number as
;;;          its single element.
